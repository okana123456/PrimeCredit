-- PrimeCredit fee deduction repair
-- Purpose:
-- 1. Existing loans that were saved with full principal as disbursed_amount
--    will be corrected so disbursed_amount becomes:
--    principal_amount - processing_fee - first-loan registration_fee.
-- 2. The repayable balance is not changed. Clients still repay the full
--    loan amount plus interest. This only fixes the amount released to client.
